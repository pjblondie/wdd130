            "In the heart of the Whispering Woods lies the hidden realm of Mycostra, a bioluminescent forest where mushrooms glow softly like stars and the air hums with magic. Among its many fungi inhabitants lives a tiny, luminous mushroom named Glintcap. Barely the size of a pebble, Glintcap has a radiant cap that pulses gently in calming shades of blue and pink, and a curious spirit that often gets it into trouble.",

            "Glintcap lives peacefully among the roots of the Great Spore Tree, a towering fungal giant that watches over the forest. The mushrooms here live in harmony—sharing dew drops, basking in moonlight, and avoiding the deeper, darker parts of the woods. All was well until one fateful night…",

            "A dark buzzing began echoing through the treetops—the ancient evil known as Zarvox the Fly, a monstrous, glowing-eyed insect from the ruined temple of Hexadros, has awakened. Centuries ago, Zarvox was sealed in the Temple of Numbers, imprisoned behind enchanted math-lock doors to keep his chaotic energy at bay. But now, the locks are breaking—and Zarvox is on the hunt for Glintcap’s radiant core, believing it to be the final piece to fully restore his power.",

            "Glintcap, unaware of his importance, is jolted awake as the ground quakes and trees bend back in terror. He sees the fiery glow of Zarvox’s wings in the distance and knows only one thing: he must run. The forest shifts around him—paths curl into spirals, doors materialize from moss-covered stones, and glowing arches float in mid-air. Each door pulses with protective magic and will only open if Glintcap solves the ancient riddles they pose. With Zarvox gaining speed, Glintcap must dash, leap, and slide through the twisting corridors of Mycostra’s maze-like pathways. Each time he answers a question right, a portal opens just in time. One wrong move… and Zarvox is one wingbeat closer."
