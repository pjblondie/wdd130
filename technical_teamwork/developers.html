                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>     
                    Our six-person team at BYU-Idaho was given a project in our Technical Teamwork class where we needed to create a project that was both 
                    useful and involved working together. We started by looking into what students at BYUI might actually need help with and found that they 
                    needed help adjusting to getting their brain back into learning mode after short breaks. After a few class periods we came up with a 
                    temple run style trivia game. We were inspired by Temple Run and decided to create a fast-paced trivia game where players have to answer 
                    basic trivia questions (like math) to get high scores. Once we were selected we had the opportunity to work with more of the class who 
                    had skills we were able to utilize and split into 3 teams. We decided on having an Art Team, Web Development/Design Team and a Game 
                    Development Team.

                <p>
	                We were able to come up with the visuals for the game! After some discussion we decided to create a mix of 3d and 2d elements. 
                    The outer details like the plant stocks looming over the path are 3d with 2d texture while our character and the path itself is 2d. 
                    We were inspired by dark and mystical forests with glowing details. We selected the color pallet for the website and fonts.

                <h2>Web Dev Team</h2>
                <p>
                    The Web Development/Design Team was in charge of creating the website for our game. We started by figuring out what kind of information 
                    players and visitors would want to see and how to organize it in a way that made sense. We met regularly to divide up tasks like writing 
                    the HTML structure, styling with CSS, and making sure the site looked good on different screen sizes. As the project grew, we worked 
                    closely with the Art Team to add in logos, background images, and icons, and made sure the colors and fonts matched the overall look 
                    of the game. We also made sure to keep the site simple to navigate while still showing off the work everyone had done. It was a team 
                    effort that involved planning, designing, coding, and a lot of debugging, but we’re proud of how the final site turned out.

                <p>
	                The Game Development Team was responsible for building the actual gameplay experience of Trivia Shrooms Adventure. 
                    We started by figuring out how to combine the endless runner style of Temple Run with trivia questions in a way that was
                     fun but also helped players switch back into a learning mindset. We used Unity to build the game and worked on mechanics like 
                     character movement, jumping, and question prompts that appear as the player runs. Throughout the process, we met with the other 
                     teams to make sure everything matched, like making sure the art fit the world and the website had accurate info. We ran into a 
                     few bugs and challenges along the way, especially when trying to keep the pace fast while still letting players read and answer 
                     questions, but we worked through them by testing often and helping each other figure things out. In the end, we built a game that’s 
                     fun, challenging, and a little chaotic—in a good way.
